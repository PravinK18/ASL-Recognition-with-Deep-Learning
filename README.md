# ASL-Recognition-with-Deep-Learning
American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary language used by many deaf 
individuals in North America, and it is also used by hard-of-hearing and 
hearing individuals.

This project aims at training a convolutional neural network to 
classify images of ASL letters. After loading, examining, and 
preprocessing the data, we will train the network and test its 
performance.
